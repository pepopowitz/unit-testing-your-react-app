## Overview

This project contains samples of unit tests written with Jest & Enzyme. These tests were written in support of a talk on unit testing your React app. The slides for the talk can be found [here](http://bit.ly/unit-testing-your-react-app).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Running The Tests

`npm test` will launch the Jest test-runner.

To view code coverage, run `npm test -- --coverage` (the extra -- is intentional.).
